# student-CRUD-DB
Basic web application created using AngularJS that maintains student details in a front-end static database.

Performs all the CRUD functions :
1. Create DB
2. Read a record
3. Update a record
4. Delete a record

An extra Sort feature added that can sort the DB based on any of the fields. 
A simple AngularJS filter is present to search for a specific record.

A php-sql back-end to make it a dynamic DB is pending.
